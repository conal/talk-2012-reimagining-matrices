Title: Inventing matrix operations -- deriving How from What

Abstract:

 >
Programs have two dimensions (among others): the *What* and the *How*. 
Correctness is a relationship between What and How, and efficiency is attained (without loss of correctness) by navigating in the space of Hows that are compatible with a What.
Programming, however, requires precision about how but not about what, and so programmers are often much more conscious about how to solve problems than what problems they're solving.
Consequently, programming tends to proceed haphazardly via guesses, hand-waved justifications, and testing -- more akin to tribal lore and craft than to math and engineering.
This talk illustrates an alternative, which is principled derivation of implementations from specifications, via the example of matrix operations.
The techniques used are widely applicable as means to discover correct algorithms and to more deeply understand known algorithms.
